## Will you go out with me?
**Will you go out with me?** is a Valentine’s 2025 website I whipped up based on an Instagram trend — a cheeky little website where you could send a link to your crush asking them out on a date.
**Super simple concept —**  when your crush opened the link, they’d see *“Will you go out with me?”* with two buttons (**Yes** and **No**).
**But here’s the catch —** the "No" button wasn’t actually clickable. Every time you hovered over it, it would jump to a different part of the screen, dodging the mouse. 😈
So eventually… The only option left was **Yes**. Smooth, right?
Built the whole thing with **Next.js**, **Scss**, and deployed it on **Vercel**. — just lightweight and fun. 
It blew up more than expected. A couple pages and IG stories picked it up, and during Valentine’s week it was doing 1k+ visits per day.
It was a quick, playful app, but super fun to watch it take off — and it made me realise how much joy (and chaos) you can bring with a simple idea, some code, and a little humor.
